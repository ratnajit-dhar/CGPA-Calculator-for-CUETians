# CGPA-Calculator-for-CUETians

One thing I have always hated of our university student portal is that it only provides grades for the term, leaving us to manually calculate the CGPA or CGPA. This often means resorting to calculators or external websites where we have to input each grade individuallyâ€”a tedious process. And I always wanted a easier way to do so. This project aims to simplify that. Just select all the results and copy it onto this website, and it will calculate the CGPA for you.
